Hi user,

you have to put the following stuff in your bashrc:

export PATH=/home/username/sandbox/ff_gen/scripts:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/sandbox/ff_gen/objectives:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/sandbox/ff_gen:$PYTHONPATH

Of course you have to have an up to date Pydlpoly version loaded

you have to go into the pikaia directory and compile it by typing

>>> make

you have to go into the ric directory and compile it by typing

>>> make

Have fun!

P.S.: If you have questions, feel free to write an email to

johannes.duerholt@rub.de
