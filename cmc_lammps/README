 This is the lammps version including the MOF-FF routines by Hendrik.
 It is derived from the 17Nov16 version of lammps (need to adapt to a more recent version)

 Only the src and the python directory are here (hendriks files are in the src directory)
 we use the makefile in src/MAKE called Makefile.mpi

 To compile and install you can use the script ./compile_pylammps_rs or perform the steps on the command line.

 >>> make mode=shlib mpi
  
  compile a shared lib liblammps_mpi.so 

 >>> cd ../python
 >>> sudo python install.py /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

  installs .so (renamed) and the python part into the location (which is automatically in your path)
  of course you can use another manual installation mechanism and adapt your PYTHONPATH accordingly

  The following source files (.h/.cpp) are new (from hendrik) and need to be present in /src

  angle_class2_p6       (mm3 angle 6th order polynomial)
  angle_cosine_buck6d   (cosine anglef wiht 1-3 vdw) <--- now default
  angle_cosine_vdwl13   (alternative cosine anglef with 1-3 vdw) <--- should not be used with kspace 
  improper_inversion_harmonic   (wilson-desius oop a la MOF-FF)
  pair_buck6d_coul_gauss_dsf    (MOF-FF vdw buck6d and gaussian charges with damping shifted force)
  pair_buck6d_coul_gauss_long   (MOF-FF vdw buck6d and gaussian charges with long range ewald by PMMM (kspace))

  in order to work the following packages must be installed (already done, but in a fresh lammps version you
  need to switch the packages on with make yes-<packagename>

  CLASS2
  KSPACE
  MANYBODY
  MOLECULE
  USER-MISC

  In order to work with it first compile and install.
  Test if it works by "import lammps" in your Python interpreter.

  Then you need a recent molsys with a ff2lammps.py in the /utils folder.
  Best is to also get the pylmps repo (still in its infancies) which wraps around the lammps Python wrapper
  to feel a bit like pydlpoly. In particular, pylmps uses ff2lammps in order to generate the lammps input 
  either from a par/ric file or directly from MOF+ via the web API

  V 1.0  Rochus Schmid  
 
  - current lammps version 17Nov16

  V1.1 Rochus Schmid

 - added h5md (taken from 11Aug17) .. need to update the whole source 
   WARNING: you have to put the proper path to lib and include of hdf5 on your system into lib/h5md/Makefile.lammps
            in order to compile! The current setting is from my MINT 18.0
