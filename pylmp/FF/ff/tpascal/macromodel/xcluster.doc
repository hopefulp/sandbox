To see a list of topics available for the XCluster help system click on the
"List All" button.

To search the entire file enter the text to be searched for in the text area
labeled "Search Help File For:" and click on the "Search & Show" button. If
you target string is not unique you will be presented with a list of options
to select from.  There are two options which can effect the way this search 
behaves:  
	If the "Search Title Only" toggle button is enabled then the fragment
	will only be searched for in the "Title" area of the file - that is the
	topic headings.
	If the "Case Sensitive" toggle button is enabled the case of your 
	target string will be matched exactly during the search.
This method of searching will only find the first occurrence of each fragment
in the topic.

To search the current text on display in the help file enter you target 
fragment into the text area labeled "Search On-screen Text".  Clicking the
"Find Next" and "Find Previous" buttons will cycle through all the occurrences
of the target string.

[XCluster]
XCluster is the "X" interface to the "Cluster" program for the analysis of
MacroModel files.  XCluster is started from the command line by typing the
command "xcluster <filename.cmd>", where "filename.cmd" is the name of
a command file. If no command file is specified then the "Open..." item of
the File Menu can be used to open an existing file, or the "New..." option
can be used to create a new command file.

[Features]
The following is a summary of the features of XCluster Version 1.1:

Generate distance matrices by pair-wise comparison of all structures
	in a MacroModel file.  The metric for "distance" is user specifiable
	and can be RMS atomic position between structure with or without rigid
	body superimposition or RMS difference between a set of torsion angles.

Perform a "cluster" analysis on the resultant distance matrix.  This
	can also be done on an externally generated distance matrix.

Visualize a number of statistics which arise from the clustering 
	process.  Analysis of these often allows a "good" clustering to be
	identified.

Visualize the distance matrix in a "color depth" display. Here the
	distance matrix is represented as a square plot made up if NxN smaller
	squares (where N is the number of structures in the input file). The 
	color of each square is related to the value of the corresponding 
	distance matrix element. There are ten equally spaced color levels
	with the purple representing the lowest valued elements and red 
	representing the largest distances in the matrix.
	This can be viewed for the distance matrix in the original input order 
	or the "generic order" produced by the cluster analysis.

Visualize the clustering process in the "Clustering Mosaic". This is
	a display which records how the clustering analysis was performed.
	There are N vertical columns which represent the N input conformations.	
	These are displayed in the "generic" order from left to right. There
	are also N horizontal columns which represent the N clustering levels.
	In the first row, each column is in it's own cluster, and is enclosed
	by a vertical line.  In the next row, two of the conformations come
	together to form a "cluster" and there are not N-1 clusters.  This
	process continues as one goes down the plot until the N'th row is
	reached where there is only one cluster.

Print the membership of any cluster.  The "Cluster Membership" panel allows
	the user to input any level of clustering (from 1-N) and then by
	clicking on the "Membership" button the composition of the clusters
	will be printed to the message window and the .clg file.

Create a file of the distance matrix in the input or the "generic" order.

Create a file of the MacroModel structures arranged in their clusters at any
specified level. The "Cluster File" item in the Write option of the File menu
allows the user to create a file containing the MacroModel structures from the
input file written to a MacroModel file format.  Similar files containing
"representative" and "average" structures may also be written.

[File Menu]
The File Menu contains the following items:

	New...
		Create a new command file.

	Open...
		Open an existing command file for editing.

	Write...
		Write a "Cluster File".
	   or
		Write a "Representative Structure File"
	   or
		Write an "Average Structure File"
	   or
		Write a distance matrix file in the original input order.
	   or
		Write a distance matrix file in the "generic order".

	Quit
		Exit the "XCluster" program.

[New...]
The "New" item in the "File" menu is used to create a new command file.
When this option is selected, a panel will appear which is used to generate
the command files.
[Open...]
The "Open" item in the "File" menu will present the user with a file selection box
which has the filter string set to "*.cmd", the default sufix for the
command file.  Once a a file is selected then it will be read by the
program and the current settings displayed in a graphical command file
editor.  The editor panel can be used to change the settings or the job
can be run without modification to the command file.

[Write...]
The "Write" item in the "File" brings up a dialog box which contains 
pop-up menu with the choice of several files types which can be written:

	Choosing "Cluster File" which controls the writing
	of a MacroModel format cluster file.  To write a cluster file enter the
	clustering level at which the file is to be written and use
	the radio buttons to choose whether to write out all or just a 
	single cluster at the given level.  A default filename
	will be constructed (jobname-n_m.cls; where n is the clustering level
	and m is the cluster number; if writing all clusters the filename will
	be just jobname-n.cls). 
	This filename can be overridden by editing the filename text area.
	Clicking the "write" button will begin the writing of the cluster
	file. This option is not available if the clustering was done on 
	an external distance matrix file.

	Choosing "Representative Structure File" allows
	the writing of a MacroModel representative structure file.
	The representative structure file contains a single representative
	structure for each cluster at a given clustering level.
	To write a representative structure file enter the clustering level
	at which the file is to be written and use the radio buttons to
	choose whether to write out "all" or just a "single" cluster at the
	given cluster level.  A default file name will be constructed
	(jobname-n_m.rep; where n is the clustering level and m is the number of
	the cluster which is to be written).  This filename can
	be overridden by editing the filename text area.  Clicking on the "write"
	button will begin the writing of the representative structure file.
	This option is not available if the clustering was done on an
	external distance matrix file.

	Choosing "Average Structure File" allows
	the writing of a MacroModel average structure file.
	The representative structure file contains a average representative
	structure for each cluster at a given clustering level.
	To write a representative structure file enter the clustering level
	at which the file is to be written and use the radio buttons to
	choose whether to write out "all" or just a "single" cluster at the
	given cluster level.  A default file name will be constructed
	(jobname-n_m.avg; where n is the clustering level and m is the number of
	the cluster which is to be written).  This filename can
	be overridden by editing the filename text area.  Clicking on the "write"
	button will begin the writing of the representative structure file.
	This option is not available if the clustering was done on an
	external distance matrix file.


	Choosing "Distance File" allows the user to write out a file 
	containing all the distance matrix data.

	Choosing "Generic Distance File" allows the user to write out a file 
	containing all the distance matrix data in the generic order as 
	produced from the the clustering analysis.

[Quit]
Choosing the "Quit" command from the file menu will cause the XCluster program
to exit.  Any procedures which are running will be terminated.


[Visualization Menu]
The "Visualization"  menu contains several options for graphical analysis
of the results of distance matrix generation and clustering analysis:

	Clustering Statistics - this shows several line-graphs of statistics
	generated during the clustering analysis.

	Distance Map - a graphical representation of the distance matrix.  This
	can be viewed in the original input order or the re-ordered "generic" 
	order which is produced during the cluster analysis.

	Clustering Mosaic - a graphical representation showing how the clusters
	were formed during the clustering analysis.

	Cluster Membership - a textual representation of the cluster composition
	at any level of clustering.

[Clustering Statistics]
The clustering statistics panel is used to view statistics concerning each 
clustering in a "line graph" format. The plot is controlled by two sets of radio 
buttons on the left hand side of the panel. The top set controls the variable 
plotted on the X axis. This can be either clustering level (from 1 to the number 
of conformers) or clustering value, the critical distance value at which each 
new clustering is formed.

Another set of radio buttons control which variable is plotted on the Y 
(vertical) axis. The possible values are : 

            Minimum Separation Level.
            Maximum Separation Level.
            Effective Number of Clusters.
            Cluster Sizes ( The effective and actual number of clusters, and the 
            minimum, maximum and average cluster sizes at each new clustering).

The range of each axis is initially set to encompass the full range of the data. It 
may be desirable to "zoom in" on one particular region. This is controlled by 
the text fields in the left hand side of the panel. After new values are entered 
for the minimum and maximum values of each axis, the "Set Values" button can 
be depressed and the plot re drawn. The original scaling can be reinstated by 
pressing the "Restore Values" button. Axis ranges are also reset to the default 
values when the axes modes are changed. No checking is done on the values 
which are set in range fields. Entering a "minimum" value which is larger 
than the "maximum" will effectively reverse direction of the axis.

Any of the points displayed in a plot can be "picked" by moving the mouse 
pointer into that point and clicking on the left-most mouse button. When a 
point has been successfully selected with the mouse a beep will sound. It may 
be necessary to adjust the range of the axes values in order to be able to select 
the points clearly. The effect of picking a point is two-fold. First, the 
clustering level corresponding to that point is entered in the "Clustering 
Level" field of the "Cluster Membership" dialog. The second effect is described 
below in the "Distance Map" description.

The "PostScript" button is used to create an encapsulated PostScript 
representation of the clustering statistics window suitable for printing on a 
Laser printer. The dialog box which appears when the PostScript button is 
clicked on has a button which is labeled : "centered on page". By default this is 
off and the image will be approximately the size it appears on the screen. If 
the "center on page" toggle button is clicked on then the image will be sized to 
be centered on and fill most of an 8.5 by 11 inch page.

The "File/Write..." button will bring up the file writing dialog to allow
writing of a number of different types of output files.


[Distance Map]
This panel displays a pictorial representation of the difference matrix in 
either the generic or the input conformation ordering. The distance values 
are represented by a set of arbitrary colors (or grays on a gray scale monitor) 
representing values at equal increments between the minimum and maximum 
values in the distance matrix. 

The distance matrix can be viewed in either the originals (input) order or the 
generic order( see "How it Works" in the manual).  Which mode of viewing is 
active is controlled by the pair of radio buttons on the left hand side of 
the panel.

In the distance matrix display black is used to color any elements which are 
less than or equal to a given clustering value.  This can be a useful aid for 
highlighting clusterings. There are several methods for controlling the 
clustering level or value at which elements in the distance matrix display are 
colored black:

The color bar.
The color bar to the left of the matrix display indicates the colors which are 
used to represent the range of values in the distance matrix display.  Clicking 
in the color bar will set the current value in proportion to the position up the 
color bar the click is made.

The "value" field.
To the left of the color bar is a text field which displays the current clustering 
value.  Elements in the distance matrix which are less than or equal to this 
value will be colored black.  There are two methods for changing the value in 
this field.  Firstly as new value can be entered directly into the text field and 
the return key pressed. The value entered must be a valid real number and 
must be less than the maximum element in the distance matrix.  To the right of 
the text field is an upward and downward facing arrow button.  These are used 
to "step" through the list of unique distance values.  Clicking the "up" arrow 
button will advance the clustering value to the next unique value in the 
distance matrix. If an attempt is made to advance past the maximum value of 
below 0.0 (the minimum) a beep will sound.

The "level" field.
The clustering level is can be controlled from the "level" text field in a similar 
way to that described above for the clustering value.  A new value in the range 
1 to the number of conformers can be entered directly into the field and the 
return key pressed.  Alternatively the arrow keys to the right of the field can 
be used to increment or decrement the clustering level. If a plot of the 
clustering statistics is visible at the same time as the distance map; clicking on 
a point displaced in a clustering statistic graph will enter the corresponding 
clustering level into the clustering level text field of the distance map display 
and the display will be updated to reflect this new level.

It is possible to get further information about any element in the distance map 
by moving the mouse pointer over the distance matrix element and clicking 
the left mouse button. A readout of the original and generic conformation 
numbers and the distance value will appear in the text area on the left of the 
panel. When the mouse button is released the readout continues and the 
selected distance matrix element is highlighted by flashing white.  At this 
stage selected element can be changed by use of the arrow keys on the 
keyboard.  Pressing any of the arrow keys will move the selected element on 
square in the position in the appropriate direction. This is useful for querying 
a complex distance matrix display as it allows "fine-tuning" of the readout.  To 
clear the flashing element and the readout click the middle mouse button in 
the distance matrix display.

When a point on the map is selected the dialog box which is accessed from
the "Write..." option of the "File" menu will be updated with the current
clustering level and cluster number.  The cluster number is taken as the
X-axis value of the currently selected point on the map.

The "PostScript" button is used to create an encapsulated PostScript 
representation of the map display suitable for printing on a Laser printer. The 
dialog box which appears when the PostScript button is clicked on has a button 
which is labeled : "centered on page". By default this is off and the image will 
be approximately the size it appears on the screen. If the "center on page" 
toggle button is clicked on then the image will be sized to be centered on and 
fill most of an 8.5 by 11 inch page.

The "File/Write..." button brings up the dialog box which is used to
write a number of different output files.

[Clustering Mosaic]
The clustering mosaic is a visual representation of the formation of clusters 
during the clustering process. Refer to the description in the FIGURES OF 
MERIT section of the manual, under the Reordering Entropy, of the generically
ordered conformation list as a list of structures separated by partitions. As the 
threshold level increases, partitions are removed, and at any level a set of 
conformations without partitions between them represents a cluster.

Each row of the mosaic display represents the set of partitions at a given 
clustering level, the levels ascending as we go down the display. Each column 
of the display represents a conformation in the generic ordering going from 
left to right. If you place the mouse at any position and depress any button, 
you will see a display of the conformation number directly under the cursor, 
and where it stands in the generic ordering; in addition you will see a readout 
of the threshold level under the cursor. If the mouse button is released the 
crosshair cursor will remain in at the last mouse pointer position. The 
crosshairs can be repositioned by the use of the arrow keys on the keyboard 
which will move the cursor one element in each the appropriate direction. 
The readout and the mosaic crosshairs can be cleared from the display by 
clicking on the middle mouse button while the pointer is in the mosaic display 
or by clicking the mouse button outside the mosaic boundary.

In the first clustering level (first row), each conformation is in its own 
cluster, so each conformation has partitions on both sides. As one progresses 
down the plot the individual conformations begin to agglomerate into clusters; 
these further agglomerate, until finally there is a single cluster which 
contains all the conformations.

The mosaic can be drawn in three differnet modes, controlled by the
radio buttons on the left hand part of the panel.  "By Clustering Level" 
will result in a mosaic where every row in the mosaic is a constant height,
representing the integer value of each level. "By Clustering Value" will
result in the mosaic being drawn with the space between rows proportional
to the threshold value at each clustering level.  "By ln(Clustering Value)"
is similar but in this case the space between each row is marked by the
logarithm of the threshold value at each level.  Note that both of the
representations which use clustering levels may result in mosaics where
the levels are overlapped - if this is the case a warning area will be
printed in the read out area to the left of the mosaic display area.

The "PostScript" button allows the production of a PostScript representation 
as in the "distance map" display.

The "File/Write" button will bring up the file writing dialog box to
allow writing output files in a number of different formats.

The "MacroModel Read Structure" is active when the crosshairs are active in
the mosaic area and MacroModel is running.  Clicking on this button will send
a request to MacroModel to read the structure which corresponds to the currently
selected column.  The "Delete before Read" toggle button is used to control 
whether MacroModel will delete the current structure(s) when reading in the
new one.


[Cluster Membership]
The cluster membership option of the "Visualization" is used for displaying
the membership of the clusters at any clustering level. When this option is
picked then a panel appears.  This has a text field for entry of the clustering
level of interest.  When a valid clustering level is entered (i.e from 1
to the number of conformations in the file) the "Show Membership" button will
become active.  If the "Show Membership" button is clicked the clustering 
membership for the given clustering level will be displayed in the message
window.

The cluster membership panel will remain active until the "close" button is
clicked.  There is an interaction between the cluster membership panel and
the "Clustering Statistics" visualization mode.  When the clustering statistics
are viewed with the X-axis set to "Clustering Level" then clicking in one
of the graph points will enter the clustering level corresponding to that point
into the clustering membership panel.

[Message Area]
The message area is the scrollable text area underneath the menu bar in the
main XCluster panel. All the output from the clustering process and most of
the error messages will appear in this window.  The scroll bar to the right
of the window can be used to review items which are no longer visible.
While the text in the message area is "read-only" it can be selected with
the mouse and pasted into a text editor.

[Progress Area]
The progress area is used to display the progress of time consuming operations
such as reading in structure files,  calculating the distance matrices and
performing the clustering. The extent of the operation is indicated by the
progress bar, a rectangle which advances across the bottom of the screen
during the operation.  In the top right of the progress area is a counter
region which gives a numerical indication of the current extent of the operation.



[Command Editor Panel]
Choosing the "New..." or "Open..." options from the "File" menu will bring up 
the "Command Editor  Panel".

If the command editor panel is accessed from the "New..." command it will be 
displayed initially with all the values set to defaults. If the command file panel 
is accessed from the "Open..." command then the values are set on the basis of 
the command in the command file. There are four areas in the command file 
editor. At the top there is a region with three button which control the major 
functions of the command editor panel.


The Start Button: 
	This button will write the current settings to the command file and 
begin the job. Note that the current command file will be overwritten. The 
start button will not be enabled while the "structure file" or "data file" text 
fields are empty or the "atom/torsion" list panels are active.

The Write Button: 
	The write button will write the current settings shown in the command 
editor panel out to the command file. None of the operations in the command 
file are executed. Note that the current command file will be overwritten with 
the values in the command editor panel. The write button will not be enabled 
while the "structure file" or "data file" text fields are empty or the 
"atom/torsion" list panels are active.


The Cancel Button: 
	The cancel button is used to dismiss the command editor panel. No 
changes will be made to the command file.
The second section of the command editor panel is used to specify the names if 
the input files for the program. The command file text field contains the name 
of the command file which has been read and will be written to or created 
when the "Start" or "Write" buttons are clicked. Below this is a text field for the 
name of the input data file. This can be either a MacroModel  structure file or a 
distance matrix file. Which file is expected is controlled by the set of radio 
buttons to the left of this field. The "Choose File" button on the right of the 
input data file field is used to select a new structure or distance file. Clicking 
on this button will bring up the standard Motif file selection box. The final 
component of the file selection region is the "MacroModel Read File" button. 
This will only be active if MacroModel is running when the command editor 
panel is opened. Clicking in this button will tell MacroModel to read the 
structure file which is shown in the structure file text field. This button will 
not be enabled if the "Distance Matrix File" option is enabled.



The third part of the command file is used to control the method of distance 
matrix generation and specify which atoms are to be used in the comparison 
This panel will only be active if the "Structure File" button is enabled; that
is it has no meaning in the "Distance Matrix" mode. On the left of this region is a 
set of three radio buttons which allow the user to select one of the three 
distance matrix methods. These are "Atomic RMS. after superimposition" 
(Arms:) , "Torsional RMS." (Trms:) and "Atomic RMS. without Superimposition:" 
(Nrms:). To the right of these controls are another set of radio button which 
are used to specify comparison atoms for the distance matrix generation 
method. For each of the atomic RMS. methods the options are "All atoms" , "All 
heavy atoms" (i.e. all non-hydrogen atoms) or a list of atoms for comparison. 
When the distance matrix mode is set to the "Torsional RMS." the only option is 
to use a list of torsions. Below the comparison atoms radio buttons is a push 
button which opens the atom list or torsion list panel. 


[Atom List Panel]
The atom list panel is used to build a list of comparison atoms. This panel can 
function in two modes. The atom number to be included in the list can be 
entered from the keyboard, or the list can be defined by picking atoms on a 
structure displayed by MacroModel. To add atom numbers from the keyboard, 
place the mouse pointer in the text entry region at the top of the panel and 
enter numbers, pressing the "return" key after every entry. The numbers will 
appear in the scrollable list area on the right of the panel. Selecting atoms by 
picking from MacroModel is accomplished as follows. First MacroModel must be 
running when the command editor panel is opened. If MacroModel is not 
active use the "Cancel" button to close the command editor panel and first start 
up MacroModel. Once MacroModel is active use the "MacroModel Read File" 
button to get MacroModel to read the first structure from the file. When the 
atom list panel is active, any atoms which are picked on the structure which is 
displayed in the MacroModel window will be added to the list. It is possible to 
temporarily turn the MacroModel picking off by turning the "Picking from 
MMOD" button to the "off" mode (i.e. not filled in). Note that this button is "On" 
by default if MacroModel is running when the panel is opened. The "Get 
Working Set" button is used to add all the atoms specified in the current 
MacroModel working set to the atom list. 

In both methods of adding atoms to the list, no duplicates will be entered into 
the list. If a duplicate atom is specified a beep will sound and a warning 
message will be placed in the main message area. Note also that no checking is 
done to ensure that atom numbers entered from the keyboard are permissible 
for the current structure.

The "Delete" button in the atom list panel is used to delete the currently 
highlighted entry in the list. The "Clear" button will clear all the entries in 
the list. The list panel can be dismissed with either the "Cancel" button, which 
will close the panel  disregarding any changes made since the panel was 
opened or the "Done" button which will close the panel and add the atoms in 
the list to the command file list.



[Torsion List Panel.]
The operation of the torsion list panel is very similar to that of the atom list 
panel described above. The main difference is that torsion are specified by 
either entering four integers in the text area at the top of the panel, or by 
picking four atoms using MacroModel. 

In both methods of adding torsions to the list, no duplicate torsions will be 
entered into the list. If a duplicate torsion is specified a beep will sound and a 
warning message will be placed in the main message area. Note also that no 
checking is done to ensure that the torsions entered from the keyboard are 
permissible for the current structure.

The "Delete" button in the torsion list panel is used to delete the currently 
highlighted entry in the list. The "Clear" button will clear all the entries in 
the list. The torsion list panel can be dismissed with either the "Cancel" button, 
which will close the panel  disregarding any changes made since the panel 
was opened or the "Done" button which will close the panel and add the 
torsions in the list to the command file list.
