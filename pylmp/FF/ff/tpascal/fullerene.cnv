C  Conversion table for fullerenes                                      
C
C  Record format is 1X,A3, 1X,A7, 1X,A7, 1X,I2, 1X,I2, 1X,F8.4 and
C  corresponds to:
C
C  RES OLDTYP NEWTYP MB NL CHARGE
C
C  where RES    = residue name
C        OLDTYP = old atom type (type on input data file)
C        NEWTYP = new atom type (type used in calculations)
C        MB     = maximum number of covalent connections (for building)
C        NL     = number of lone pairs at MB (for H-bond acceptors)
C        CHARGE = charge on atom (used in electrostatic calculation)

*  ms   -9/9/87
*     *  Wild card has been added to all the amino acid residues
*        to allow the possibilities of various number of hydorgens
*        (deuteriums) being attached to carbon or nitrogen.  
*     
*     *  Hydrogens (& deuteriums) with different format ( for Kollman's)
*        have also been added.
*
*  srl  -4/21/88  
*     *  add implicit hydrogens to some carbons and nitrogens of the
*     *  nucleic acid bases and make the carbonyl carbons O_2 instead of
*     *  O_R
