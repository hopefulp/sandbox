README for CHARMM topology/parameter files for OPLS-AA (opls.rtf, opls.prm)

Proper usage of these files requires CHARMM software version c28b1 or greater.
If you are presently using c28b1, please check that you have the latest release,
as not all of the pertinant code was included in the initial release, but was 
included in a later bugfix.  Compilation of CHARMM requires that the OPLS
keyword be included in pref.dat at compile time.  The relevant code has added 
the ability to combine Lennard-Jones radii with a geometric average, and use 
V2-Fourier terms for improper dihedrals.  The CHARMM program compiled with the 
OPLS option in pref.dat can still use all other previously released topology and
parameter files (CHARMM22, CHARMM19, etc.).

Atom and residue names in the OPLS-AA topology file agree with that in CHARMM22.
Consequently, any CHARMM script that reads CHARMM22 topology and parameter files
can be converted to using OPLS-AA by adjusting the appropriate file OPEN
statements.  The atom types have the OPLS atom type embedded within them for
easy cross-reference.  For example, type H140 in opls.rtf and opls.prm is 
type 140 the OPLS-AA parameter files available from Prof. Jorgensen.

The topology and parameter files here include only the protein portion of the
OPLS-AA force field.  User-defined topology and parameter files are required for
other functionalities.

While the OPLS-AA topology and parameter files are compatible with all
functionality within CHARMM that is also compatible with CHARMM22, minimizations
and simulations with a distance-dependent dielectric (RDIE) is not recommended 
as collapse of atoms with hydrogens on heteroatoms is possible, causing
unreasonable structures and energies.  Also, there is no current 
optimzied parameter set for the linearized form of the Generalized Born equation
as currently implemented in CHARMM.
