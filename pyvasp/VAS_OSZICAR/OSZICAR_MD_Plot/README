Plot_OSZICAR_MD.py is a Python script which allows to plot all OSZICAR quantities for a molecular dynamic calculation.
All quantities are :
    T  : is the current temperature.
    E  : is the total free energy (including the kinetic energy of the ions and the energy of the Nosé thermostat).
    F  : is the total free energy  (at this point the energy of the reference atom has been subtracted).
    E0 : is the energy for sigma-> 0 .
    EK : is the kinetic energy.
    SP : is the potential energy of the Nosé thermostat.
    SK : is the corresponding kinetic energy.
