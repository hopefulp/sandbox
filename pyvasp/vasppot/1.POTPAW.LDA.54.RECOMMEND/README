LDA PAW datasets version 54, including the GW variety (original release 2015-09-04). When read by VASP these files yield identical results as the files distributed before. The POTCAR files, however, differ from previous versions: (i) the TITLE string is set to the directory in which the POTCAR file reside for: O_GW_new, Ge_GW, G_GW_new, Cd_GW, Br_GW, B_GW. (ii) HASH key added to all POTCAR files. FOR STRICT COMPATIBILITY, download the set of potentials in potpaw_LDA_PBE_52_54_orig.tar.gz!
