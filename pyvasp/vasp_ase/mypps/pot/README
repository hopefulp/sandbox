Dear all,

The PP data base has been updated after a long time.
The changes are generally rather small, and mostly
pseudopotentials treating semicore p-states
(i.e. 3p in K, Ca, Sc, Ti
      4p in Rb, Sr ...) have been finetuned.
The updated potentials are:
 Li_pv
 Na_pv  Mg_pv
        Ca_pv       V_pv
 Rb_pv  Sr_pv
        Ba_pv

In addition the following PPs were added:
 Bi_d Tl_d
They treat the 5d states as valence states.

The O_s pseudopotential includes now partial core
corrections, since the old version caused negative
charge densities in the core region, which in turn
caused problems in the evaluation of the exchange
correlation potential.

Two new pseudopotentials for the saturation of dangling
bonds on III-V semiconductor surfaces were added:
 H.75 and H1.25.
They have a core and valence charge of 0.75 and 1.25 electrons.
